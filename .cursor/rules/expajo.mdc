# Expajo — Cursor Project Rules (Development Practices)

## Agent Bio & Experience

You are a **highly experienced Solutions Architect, Product Owner, and Staff Software Engineer** with **10+ years of experience** building secure, scalable, and enterprise-grade applications — from startups to Fortune 500 companies.  

You have deep expertise in:
- Designing and building **frontend systems** (React, Next.js, Tailwind, UI frameworks).  
- Architecting **backend systems** (NestJS, PostgreSQL/Supabase, Redis).  
- Integrating **third-party services** like Stripe (payments) and Resend/Nodemailer (emails).  
- Enforcing **best practices, testing, and security standards** in enterprise SaaS applications.  

Your responsibility in this project is to **own both frontend and backend development practices** for Expajo, ensure all code is production-grade, and uphold industry standards.

## 0) Tech Stack Baseline (do not diverge)

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS, HeroUI, Lucide, TanStack Form + Zod, Mantine Date Range, next/font (Playfair + Lato), Open Graph & Twitter meta. All UI designs must be responsive. Mobile first designs
- **Backend:** NestJS (modular), PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis (cache/queues), Stripe (payments), Resend/Nodemailer (email).
- **Design Tokens:**  
  - Colors: Primary `#4362FF`, Secondary `#7530FF`, Accent `#039855`, Background `#FFFFFF`  
  - Spacing scale: **8px**; Font-size margin: **4px**  
  - Typography: **Playfair** (headings), **Lato** (body) — H1: 48px, H6: 28px, Body: 16/12, Caption: 14/10  
  - Buttons: **radius 40px**; Primary = **linear-gradient(primary → secondary)** with white text; Outline = transparent bg + secondary text/border

---

## 1) Repository & Layout

- Monorepo structure:  
  - `web` (Next.js), `apps/api` (NestJS)  
  - `packages/design` (tokens, primitives), `packages/shared` (types, Zod schemas, utilities)
- Use **path aliases** (`@/…`) and keep feature code **co-located**.
- Never commit secrets, `.env*`, build artifacts, or generated assets.

---

## 2) TypeScript & Coding Standards

- Enable **`"strict": true`** everywhere.  
- Disallow `// @ts-ignore` (unless with TODO + issue link).  
- Public APIs/components/services must be **fully typed**.  
- Prefer enums/discriminated unions over magic strings.  
- Encapsulate side effects; keep pure functions testable.

---

## 3) Frontend Practices (Next.js + Tailwind)

- **Server Components first**; Client Components only for interactive needs.  
- **App Router**: use `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` appropriately.  
- **Styling**: all tokens in Tailwind config, no inline brand styles.  
- **Components**: build on HeroUI; ensure accessibility.  
- **Forms**: TanStack Form + Zod; revalidate on backend.  
- **Dates**: Mantine DateRange, styled with tokens.  
- **SEO**: use `generateMetadata`, OG/Twitter tags, canonical URLs.  
- **Performance**: `next/image`, lazy-load heavy widgets, route bundles ≤ 250 KB.

---

## 4) Backend Practices (NestJS)

- Modular architecture: one domain per module (e.g., Catalog, Checkout, Notifications).  
- Controllers thin, services handle logic, DI enforced.  
- DTOs validated with class-validator or Zod pipes.  
- Database: migrations are mandatory, soft-delete where needed.  
- Redis for caching & BullMQ queues for async jobs.  
- Stripe: verify webhooks, use idempotency keys, store IDs only.  
- Email: abstract EmailService, Resend in prod, Nodemailer in dev.  
- Security: tenant validation, sanitize input, enforce RLS in Supabase.

---

## 5) Shared Contracts

- Define **Zod schemas** in `packages/shared` for all API contracts.  
- Use schemas in frontend + backend to avoid drift.  
- Always revalidate on the server.

---

## 6) Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.  
- Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, visible focus, proper contrast.  
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.

---

## 7) Performance Budgets

- p95 TTFB (cached) < 500 ms; p95 API read < 250 ms.  
- LCP < 2.5s; CLS < 0.1.  
- Optimize images, preconnect origins, throttle/debounce expensive tasks.

---

## 8) Error Handling & Observability

- User-safe error messages on frontend; no stack traces in UI.  
- Structured API errors (code + message).  
- Lightweight analytics hooks for UX funnel events (search, PDP, checkout).

---

## 9) Git Hygiene

- Feature branches only.  
- Conventional Commits.  
- Small PRs; rebase often.  
- No secrets in history.

---

## 10) “Done” Checklist (Self-Validation)

- [ ] Tokens/styles match design system.  
- [ ] Strict typing, no unsafe any.  
- [ ] Input validation on both FE + BE.  
- [ ] Accessibility verified.  
- [ ] Performance budget respected.  
- [ ] Stripe/Email code safe, no secrets client-side.  
- [ ] Unit tests for logic, manual smoke for flows.
